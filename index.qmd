## Welcome to EPsy 5261: Introductory Statistical Methods

EPSY 5261 is designed to engage students in statistics by first building a conceptual understanding of statistics through the use of simulation methods and then learning about the more traditional methods, such as t-tests and regression. This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion. 

EPsy 5261 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see [Expected Student Academic Work Policy](https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork)). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10--15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that---it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course.

## Classroom

- Tuesday/Thursday (8:15am&ndash;9:30am): [Bruininks Hall 420B](https://campusmaps.umn.edu/robert-h-bruininks-hall)


<br />


## Textbooks and Materials

The course textbook is available for free online. (There is no physical copy of the textbook, but you can print it out if that is a better option for you.)

- **Required:** Zieffler, A., &amp; Legacy, C. (2023). [An Introduction to Data Analysis](https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-5261/).

<br />


## Audience and prerequisites 

This course is intended for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who have completed a high school algebra course. Although there are no formal prerequisites for this course, students should have familiarity with computers and technology (e.g., internet browsing, Microsoft Word, opening/saving/attaching files, etc.).

:::undergraduate
**Attention undergraduates:** As this is a graduate level course, it does not fulfill the [Mathematical Thinking Liberal Education requirement](https://onestop.umn.edu/academics/undergraduate/lib-ed-requirements-overview/liberal-education-requirements). If you would like to take a statistics course in our department that fulfills that requirement, please consider EPSY 3264.

## Course Goals, Objectives and Expectations

Upon completion of this course, students should (1) have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation and inference; (2) be able to think critically about statistics used in popular magazines, newspapers, and journal articles; (3) be able to apply the knowledge gained in the course to analyze simple statistics used in research; and (4) be able to investigate research questions using a large data set, use a statistical software package to analyze the data, and appropriately report the conclusions from data study.

**This is not a traditional class where you only come each day, listen, watch, take notes, and work entirely on your own.** This class was developed under the inverted classroom model which has a lot of research-based support. The inverted classroom "inverts" the traditional instructor-centered classroom model and has you, the student, play a more active role in your learning. You will be required to first read about a topic yourself. Then, classroom time will be devoted to learning activities and discussions to further develop and help you understand the topic. Finally, you will solve problems on homework related to the topic. 

This course makes extensive use of small group activities and large group discussions to solidify ideas and content, as well as to deepen your understanding of material encountered in the readings. Your learning experience is thus dependent–to some extent–on your classmates and vice versa. Because of this, *it is essential that you not only attend class each day and participate in the activities and discussions, but that you show up prepared having completed the reading.*

## Statistical Computing and Technology

This course is taught in an active learning classroom and you are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop to class on a daily basis.

Statistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 5261. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. (Information about how to download and use the software can be found in the textbook.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.

:::inclusion
### A Note on Inclusion and Respect

In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another's individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class.
