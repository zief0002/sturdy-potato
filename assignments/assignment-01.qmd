## Instructions

Download the [assignment01.zip](files/assignments/lab-assignment-01.zip) folder and unzip it. This

You will use the *films.csv* data set to answer questions in this lab. The [data codebook](https://zief0002.github.io/barbieland/assignments/films.html) includes a description of how the data were collected and of each of the attributes included in the data. 

Use the code chunks in the *assignment01.qmd* file to load packages and import the data. (Reference the in-class activity from Day 3 if you need to remember how to do this.) You can also do any computations needed for the assignment in this QMD document.

# Questions

Submit a PDF document of your responses to the following questions. 

1. Print the first 10 rows of the dataset to make sure it was imported correctly. Copy-and-paste (or screenshot) the output from this function into the document you will submit. If you copy-and-paste the output into your document, change the font to a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Consolata).

2.  What does a row represent in this data set? 

3. What type of attribute is `duration` (categorical or quantitative)? How can you tell?

4. What type of attribute is `genre` (categorical or quantitative)? How can you tell?

5. Using the `df_stats()` function, create a table of the `genre` attribute and have it display proportions. Copy-and-paste (or screenshot) the output from this function into the document you will submit. If you copy-and-paste the output into your document, change the font to a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Consolata).

6. Based on the output from Question 5, what proportion of movies in this dataset are action movies?

7. Using the `df_stats()` function, compute the summary statistics for the `duration` attribute. Copy-and-paste (or screenshot) the output from this function into the document you will submit. If you copy-and-paste the output into your document, change the font to a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Consolata).

8. What is the mean movie duration? Write a single sentence interpreting this value in the context of the duration of the movie. **(2pts.)**

9. Create a histogram of the movie durations. **(4pts.)**
    + Update the *x*- and *y*-axis labels.
    + Color the bars and bar borders of the histogram.
    + Insert a picture of the plot into your word-processed document. Re-size it so that it does not take up more room than necessary. (But, make sure the labels are still readable.)
    
10. Where is "most" of the data in your histogram? (Note: You can give your best guess here, but we will formalize this later in the semester) Interpret this in the context of the duration of the movie. **(2pts.)**

## How do I submit the assignment?

Create a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:

- [ ] All group members' names are on the assignment.
- [ ] All figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.
- [ ] No R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).
- [ ] Do not submit the QMD file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.
