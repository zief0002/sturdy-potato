This assignment is worth 20 points. Each question is worth 1 point unless otherwise noted.\nformat: html\ndate: today\n---\n\n\n<!-- Should more money be spent on public schools or should that money be spent elsewhere? Both sides of this ongoing public debate have been argued passionately, using a multitude of anecdotal evidence. Although we will not settle this debate, we will examine data akin to the types of data that policy makers use to make funding decisions.  -->\n\n<!-- The goal of this assignment is to give you experience fitting and interpreting simple regression models. In this assignment, you will use the data from the file *state-education.csv* to examine the relationship between teacher salaries and student total SAT scores at the state level. -->\n\n\n\n<!-- - [[CSV]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/rustic-penguin/main/data/state-education.csv) -->\n<!-- - [[Data Codebook]](https://zief0002.github.io/rustic-penguin/codebooks/state-education.html) -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/assign-02.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nSubmit a PDF document of your responses to the following questions. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\n\n- All plots should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary. \n- All figures and tables should have a name (e.g., Figure 1) *and* an appropriate caption.\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n## Part I: Creating and Interpreting Confidence Intervals\n\nA social scientist is interested in answering the following two research questions:\n\n- **Research Question 1:** How much time, on average, do adults in the U.S. in 2017 spend doing a moderate/vigorous amount of activity at work daily (in minutes)?\n- **Research Question 2:** What is the difference in the average time spent doing moderate/vigorous activity at work for adults in 2017 U.S. households between those who have reported sleep trouble and those who have not? \n\n\n\n1. Use the NHANES data set to produce a 95% confidence interval for the `modVigWork` variable using R. Then interpret this interval to answer Research Question 1. **(6pts.)**\n\nTo fully answer this question, you must:\n\n- Include the syntax you used to create the interval.\n- State the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval.\n- Include an interpretation of the confidence interval in context.\n\n\n2. The NHANES data also includes whether or not participants had told a doctor or other health professional that they had trouble sleeping (`SleepTrouble`; `Yes` if they had, and `No` if they had not). Use this variable along with the `modVigWork` variable to produce and interpret a 95% confidence interval to answer Research Question 2. **(6pts.)**\n\nTo fully answer this question, you must:\n\n- Include the syntax you used to create the interval.\n- State the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval.\n- Include an interpretation of the confidence interval in context.\n\n<br />\n\n\n## Part II: Multiple Choice Questions\n\nPlease indicate your answer clearly by including the letter for your response.\n\n3. If the sample size was increased, all else being the same, how would the widths of the confidence intervals in questions #1 and #2 change? **(2pts.)**\n\n    a. The interval widths would both decrease.\n    b. The interval widths would both increase.\n    c. The interval widths would both stay the same.\n    d. One of the interval widths would decrease, the other would increase.\n\n4. If the confidence level was increased to 98%, all else being the same, how would the widths of the confidence intervals in questions #1 and #2 change? **(2pts.)**\n\n    a. The interval widths would both decrease.\n    b. The interval widths would both increase.\n    c. The interval widths would both stay the same.\n    d. One of the interval widths would decrease, the other would increase.\n\n\nNow, suppose a confidence interval is created to estimate the mean number of hours per weekend night adults in U.S. households in 2017 slept (`SleepWkEnd`). A 90% confidence interval was created, and the resulting interval was from 8.05 and 8.31 hrs. Questions 5--8 each give a potential interpretation of this interval. For each of these questions, indicate whether the interpretation provided is correct or incorrect. (You do NOT need to explain why.)\n\n5. There is a 90% chance the confidence interval includes the sample mean number of hours per weekend night adults in U.S. households in 2017 slept. \n\n    a. Correct interpretation\n    b. Incorrect interpretation\n\n6. I am 90% confident the interval from 8.05 to 8.31 hrs will include the value of the mean number of hours per weekend night adults in U.S. households in 2017 slept.\n\n    a. Correct interpretation\n    b. Incorrect interpretation\n  \n7. About 90% of adults in U.S. households in 2017 slept between 8.05 and 8.31 hrs per weekend night.\n\n    a. Correct interpretation\n    b. Incorrect interpretation\n\n8. The probability that the population parameter is in this particular 90% confidence interval is 0.90.\n\n    a. Correct interpretation\n    b. Incorrect interpretation\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n",
