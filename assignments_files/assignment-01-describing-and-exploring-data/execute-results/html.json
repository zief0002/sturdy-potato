This assignment is worth 20 points. Each question is worth 1 point unless otherwise noted.\nformat:\n  html:\n   css: \"../assets/sticky-notes.css\"\ndate: today\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- - [[CSV]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/rustic-penguin/main/data/broadband.csv) -->\n<!-- - [[Data Codebook]](https://zief0002.github.io/rustic-penguin/codebooks/broadband.html) -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/assign-01.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nSubmit a PDF document of your responses to the following questions. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\n\n- All plots should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary. \n- All figures and tables should have a name (e.g., Figure 1) *and* an appropriate caption.\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n## Part I: Data Collection\n\n*You do not need to analyze any of the data in the .csv file to answer the questions in this section.* \n\nSuppose that it is found that among NHANES adult participants, people who are more physically active tend to be significantly less likely to have depression.\n\n1. Given how the data were collected, can we generalize this result to a larger population? If so, describe the population that we can generalize to. If not, explain why not. **(3pts.)**\n\n2.  Given how the study was designed, can we conclude that physical activity *causes* a lower likelihood of depression? If so, explain why? If not, explain why not? **(3pts.)** \n\n<br />\n\n\n## Part II: Graphical Analysis\n\nPlease answer the following questions as completely and concisely as you can and *include relevant output from RStudio in order to avoid losing any credit*. You will use your responses to Questions 3 and 4 to help answer the research question (below) in Question 5. \n\n**Research Question:** How does the distribution of hours of sleep on the weekend compare to that for hours of sleep during the week for adult Americans in 2017?\n\nVariables of interest: \n\n- `sleepWkNt`: Participants were asked to indicate the number of hours, on a week night, that they spend sleeping.  \n- `sleepWkEnd`: Participants were asked to indicate the number of hours, on a weekend night , that they spend sleeping. \n\n3. Create both a histogram and a boxplot of `sleepWkNt` and list the appropriate descriptive statistics (including the mean, median, standard deviation, five-number summary, and IQR) to describe the distribution of this variable. Your answer does not need a description; you only need to include the statistics and the graphs. **(3pts.)**\n\n4. Create both a histogram and a boxplot of `sleepWkEnd` and list the appropriate descriptive statistics (including the mean, median, standard deviation, five-number summary, and IQR). Your answer does not need a description; you only need to include the statistics and the graphs. **(3pts.)** \n\n5. Using no more than *400 words*, compare and contrast the distributions for `sleepWkNt` and `sleepWkEnd` to answer the research question by referring to the following:\n  + What similarities or differences do you see in shape, center, and variability between these two distributions?\n  + What conclusions does this lead you to draw about sleep on weekends and week nights for adult Americans in 2017?\n\n\n*Note:* Be sure your descriptions to parts a and b are understandable by someone who does not have a strong background in statistics. For example, rather than just naming the shape, describe what that shape means in context. For full credit, you will need to give the values for the appropriate statistics to measure center and variability for each distribution and describe what they mean in context, as well as how they compare for both distributions. **(8pts.)**\n\n<br />\n\n\n## How do I submit the assignment?\n\nCreate a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\n- [ ] All group members' names are on the assignment.\n- [ ] All tables are numbered and have a caption.\n- [ ] All figures are numbered and have a caption.\n- [ ] All figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\n- [ ] No R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\n- [ ] Do not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n    \n    \n",
