## Course Requirements

There are two components that make up your grade:lab assignments, and daily exit tickets. You need to complete all of the lab assignments to receive a grade in the course. *Any student who does not complete all the lab assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.*

<br />


### Lab Assignments

There will be 6 lab assignments that together are worth 80% of your grade. You will need to complete the lab assignments outside of class (as homework) and submit them via email to the instructor and TA. You can access each of the lab assignment below. For each lab assignment, you may choose to work alone or in a group. Working in a group may allow you to explore answers to a question with other students before submitting your lab assignment. Your lab assignment should be submitted via the course website before the end of the day that they are due (i.e., by 11:59 PM that day). 

As a student of statistics, working through all of the lab assignments is an important piece in building a complete understanding of the concepts, as well as allowing you to practice doing statistics. As a way of connecting the work you are doing across all lab assignments, you will explore the same data set for each lab assignment.

<br />


### Exit Tickets

Exit tickets will be given in each class session. The exit tickets will make up 20% of your grade. The "ticket" consists of a single question designed to assess your knowledge about or have you reflect on the dayâ€™s class content. These questions are to be completed individually.  The exit tickets are not marked right/wrong, but are based on whether or not you complete the ticket. 

If you miss class for a University approved reason (see *Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work*), you can make-up the exit ticket for that day by submitting the completed class activity for the day you missed. This will need to be submitted by the next class period unless you have previously made arrangements with the instructor. If you cannot complete the activity prior to the next class, you need to email the instructor prior to that class to receive an extension. Whether you will receive an extension is at the discretion of the instructor.

<br />


## Lab Assignment Due Dates

Below are the due dates for the lab assignments, as well as links to each assignment. *All assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the due date.* The due dates may change at the instructor's discretion. Any revised due dates will be announced in class and posted to the website.

## Evaluation of Student Performance

You will be evaluated on the basis of your performance on the assignments and exit tickets outlined above. Your course grade will be computed as a weighted average of: 

Type            | Individual or Group? | Percent of Grade |
--------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
Lab Assignments | Individual or Group  | 80%              |
Exit Tickets    | Individual           | 20%              |

This overall percentage in the class will then be converted to a final course grade using:

Cutoff    | Grade | Definition for Graduate Credit |
--------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
93%--100% | A     | For exceptional work, well above the minimum criteria | 
90%--92%  | A--   | For outstanding work, well above the minimum criteria | 
87%--89%  | B+    | For excellent work, significant above the minimum criteria | 
83%--86%  | B     | For work above the minimum criteria |
80%--82%  | B--   | |
77%--79%  | C+    | |
73%--76%  | C     | For work which meets the course requirements in every respect |
70%--72%  | C--   | |
63%--69%  | D     | Worthy of credit even though it fails to meet the course requirements |
0%--62%   | F     | Failed to meet minimum course requirements |

If you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B-- letter grade). The S grade does not carry grade points and is not part of the GPA calculation, but the credits will count toward the student's degree program if allowed by the college, campus, or program.

*Any student who does not complete all lab assignments by the time the final lab assignment is due without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.*

<br />


### Extra Credit Policy

Extra credit *may* be offered throughout the semester, but is not guaranteed. 

<br />


### Incomplete

Instructors may assign the registration symbol "I" for Incomplete if, at the time the incomplete is requested: (1) the student has successfully completed a substantial portion of the work of the course; and (2) due to extraordinary circumstances (*as determined by the instructor*), the student was prevented from completing the work of the course on time. The assignment of an "I" requires a written agreement with the student specifying the time and manner in which the student will complete the course requirements. For more information see [Grading and Transcripts](https://policy.umn.edu/education/gradingtranscripts).

<br />


### Accessing Course Grades

Shortly after the course, you may access your grades online at [myU](http://myu.umn.edu). Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.

## Assignment FAQs

**How do I submit the assignment?**

Create a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:

- [ ] All group members' names are on the assignment.
- [ ] All tables are numbered and have a caption.
- [ ] All figures are numbered and have a caption.
- [ ] All figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.
- [ ] No R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).
- [ ] Do not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.



**Do I need to turn in the script file?**

No...unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.


**Will you provide answer keys to the assignments?**

No. You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.


**Will you go over the answers in class?**

No. I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn't, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.


**Will you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?**

The instructor or TA will not "pre-grade" your assignment. If there is a "Preparation" part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., 'I know Question 8 is asking about [â€¦], but Iâ€™m not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?'). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! ðŸ˜„ If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general 'did I do this right'! 


**Will we be able to re-do the assignment?**

Generally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask.
