    "text": "Should more money be spent on public schools or should that money be spent elsewhere? Both sides of this ongoing public debate have been argued passionately, using a multitude of anecdotal evidence. Although we will not settle this debate, we will examine data akin to the types of data that policy makers use to make funding decisions. Specifically, we will examine whether teacher salaries are related to SAT scores at the state level.\nThis goal of this assignment is to give you more experience fitting and interpreting regression models. In this assignment, you will use the data from the file state-education.csv to examine the relationship between teacher salaries and student total SAT scores at the state level.\n\n[CSV]\n[Data Codebook]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart I: Unstandardized Regression\nBefore carrying out any analyses, create a predictor called salary_thousand that indicates the average state salary in thousands of dollars (e.g., if salary = 52143; salary_thousand = 52.143). This variable (not salary) should be used in all analyses for Part I. Fit a regression model using teacher salaries to predict SAT scores.\n\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the F-statistic in this analysis.\nWrite no more than three sentences (to be included in a publication) that summarizes the results of the omnibus analysis. A summary of the results includes a written description of what is being tested by the F-test and the statistical results. At a minimum report the F-statistic, df, and p-value. A summary should also indicate what the statistical results suggest about the compatibility of the empirical data to the null hypothesis and what this means about the potential relationship between states’ average teacher salaries and average SAT scores.\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the t-statistic for the slope.\nBased on the results of the t-test for the slope, are the empirical data consistent with the null hypothesis that the sample slope is entirely due to sampling error? Explain.\nCompute and interpret the 95% compatibility interval for the slope.\nCreate a plot that displays the regression line from the unstandardized regression analysis. This plot should also include a confidence envelope (uncertainty) for the regression line. Be sure to give your plot an appropriate caption.\n\n\n\nPart II: Centering a Predictor\nCenter the salary_thousand predictor by subtracting the mean teacher salary from each value. Call this new variable center_salary_thousand (e.g., centered_salary_thousand = salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)). This variable should be used in all analyses in Part II. Regress the SAT scores on the centered salaries.\n\nThe results of the F-test for this analysis are identical to the results of the F-test for the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested in both sets of analyses.\nThe results of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis are different than the results of the t-test for the intercept in the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested (and what that means) in both sets of analyses.\n\n\n\nPart III: Standardized Regression\nConvert the uncentered teacher salaries (salary_thousand) into z-scores by subtracting the mean salary and dividing by the standard deviation. Call this new variable z_salary (e.g., z_salary = (salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)) / sd(salary_thousand)). Also convert the SAT scores into z-scores and call that variable z_sat (e.g., z_sat = (sat - mean(sat)) / sd(sat)). Regress the SAT z-scores on the salary z-scores.\n\nThe p-value of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis is one. Explain why this is expected by referring to the hypothesis being tested in this analysis. (Hint: Think about what the intercept is and how that relates to what is being tested.)\n\n\n\nPart IV: Study Design and Causation\n\nThe test of the slope (regardless of analysis) suggests that teacher salaries seem to be related to SAT scores. Unfortunately this relationship is negative, indicating that higher teacher salaries are associated with lower SAT scores. A public-policy wonk wants to use this data to support the de-funding of public schools. Write a couple sentences that explain to this person why your analysis does not support this causal conclusion based on the study design. (Hint: Recall that inferring causation requires particular study designs. You may need to go back to your pre-requisite knowledge here.)"

    "text": "Assignment FAQs\nHow do I submit the assignment?\nCreate a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nAll group members’ names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\nDo not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\nDo I need to turn in the script file?\nNo…unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the assignments?\nNo. You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo. I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn’t, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not “pre-grade” your assignment. If there is a “Preparation” part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‘I know Question 8 is asking about […], but I’m not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?’). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! 😄 If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‘did I do this right’!\nWill we be able to re-do the assignment?\nGenerally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask."

    "text": "Policy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\nTo make up an exit ticket for a missed class you need to email your completed in-class activity to the instructor in a timely manner (within 1 week unless you specifically get approval from the instructor). Once the instructor receives your in-class activity, they will email you the exit ticket question for that day.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other AI Policy\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, are emerging tools that we will all need to consider in the next few years. These tools may be used to help you write R syntax, but not for answering any of the other questions on any assignment. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. If you do use any AI to help write syntax for any of the assignment questions you need to do the following:\n\nCite this in the assignment; failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at UMN. Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. More examples of citing AI language models are available at: https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt.\nInclude a statement about what you will do to offset the environmental impact of the energy use incurred by using the AI. Be specific in this statement. For example: I will bike to school for the next week (Jan. 01–Jan 07) rather than drive or bus.\n\nYou are also responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct. I would not trust anything AI says. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. For this reason, using AI works best for topics you understand and can quality check. Here are a couple of other things to be aware of if you decide to use AI:\n\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here).\nThe development of AI has been associated with labor abuse and other dicey ethical issues (see here and here).\n\nIf you are caught using AI to answer questions on any of the assignments, you will be given a 0 on that assignment and a Scholastic Dishonesty Report Form will be filled out and reported to the Office of Community Standards. Depending on the severity of the offense, the instructor also reserves the right to give you an “F” in the course.\n\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies—including printer trouble—will not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy’s limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

    "text": "Welcome to EPsy 5261: Introductory Statistical Methods\nEPSY 5261 is designed to engage students in statistics by first building a conceptual understanding of statistics through the use of simulation methods and then learning about the more traditional methods, such as t-tests and regression. This course uses pedagogical principles that are founded in research, such as daily small group activities and discussion.\nEPsy 5261 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Student Academic Work Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10–15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that—it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course.\n\nCACREP Standard(s) Covered in EPSY 5261 (for Counselor Ed. Students reference)\nAs a result of taking this course, Counselor Education students will:\n\nLearn about quantitative research methods (2.F.8.f)\nUnderstand how to use randomized control design in research (2.F.8.g)\nLearn statistical methods used in conducting research (2.F.8.h)\nUnderstand ways to analyze and use data in counseling (2.F.8.i)\nIdentify ethical and culturally relevant strategies for conducting, interpreting, and reporting the results of research (2.F.8.j)"

Although there are no formal prerequisites for this course, students should have familiarity with computers and technology (e.g., internet browsing, Microsoft Word, opening/saving/attaching files, etc.).\n\nAttention undergraduates: As this is a graduate level course, it does not fulfill the Mathematical Thinking Liberal Education requirement. If you would like to take a statistics course in our department that fulfills that requirement, please consider EPSY 3264."

    "section": "Course Goals, Objectives and Expectations",
    "text": "Course Goals, Objectives and Expectations\nUpon completion of this course, students should (1) have an understanding of the foundational concepts of data, variation and inference; (2) be able to think critically about statistics used in popular magazines, newspapers, and journal articles; (3) be able to apply the knowledge gained in the course to analyze simple statistics used in research; and (4) be able to investigate research questions using a large data set, use a statistical software package to analyze the data, and appropriately report the conclusions from data study.\nThis is not a traditional class where you only come each day, listen, watch, take notes, and work entirely on your own. This class was developed under the inverted classroom model which has a lot of research-based support. The inverted classroom “inverts” the traditional instructor-centered classroom model and has you, the student, play a more active role in your learning. You will be required to first read about a topic yourself. Then, classroom time will be devoted to learning activities and discussions to further develop and help you understand the topic. Finally, you will solve problems on homework related to the topic.\nThis course makes extensive use of small group activities and large group discussions to solidify ideas and content, as well as to deepen your understanding of material encountered in the readings. Your learning experience is thus dependent–to some extent–on your classmates and vice versa. Because of this, it is essential that you not only attend class each day and participate in the activities and discussions, but that you show up prepared having completed the reading."

    "text": "Statistical Computing and Technology\nThis course is taught in an active learning classroom and you are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop to class on a daily basis.\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 5261. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. (Information about how to download and use the software can be found in the textbook.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."
