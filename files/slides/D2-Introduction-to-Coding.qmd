## Learning Goals

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to ...

- Read basic code
- Write basic code
- Explain the structure of a function for coding


## Grilled Cheese Activity

Complete Part 1 of the activity.


## Introduction to Coding {.center background-image="figs/section-bg.png" background-size=contain}

## Coding

- Computers understand code
- It only understands certain things
- To write code for the computer to “run” or “execute” we write functions


## Functions

Functions are like verbs.

- We use them to tell the computer what we want to do.


## Example Function

For creating a grilled cheese we want to start by buttering the bread. For this we could use the following function:

<br /><br />

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
butter_bread()
```

<br /><br />

This function allows us to (figuratively) butter some bread.


## Arguments

Functions require arguments to help specify what we want to do. For example we want to tell the computer what type of bread to butter:

<br /><br />

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
butter_bread(type = "wheat")
```


## Notice!

- Functions have a specific structure
- If the structure isn’t correct, the computer won’t give you the right output - it might give you nothing!
- In the example below notice that:
  + There is an underscore in the function name
  + The argument is in quotation marks to specify the type of bread
  + The argument is enclosed in parenthesis
  

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
butter_bread(type = "wheat")
```


## Notice!

- Parenthesis matter.
- Capitalization matters.
- Quotes must be used correctly (need both opening and closing quotes, having them only where needed).
- Order matters.


## Using Multiple Functions

Functions can be chained together so that the output of one function is sent to another function.

<br /><br />

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
butter_bread(type = "wheat") +
add_cheese(flavor = "colby") +
fry_sandwich(time = 6)
```


## Grilled Cheese Activity (cntd.)

Complete Parts 2 and 3 of the activity.


## Looking Ahead

- We will write functions like this in class.
- We will use R Studio for writing and analyzing code.
- You will always be given functions.
- You will need to be precise when writing code and checking for bugs.
  + Bugs are a normal part of the coding process!
